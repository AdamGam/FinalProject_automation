# FinalProject_automation
### This project created to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### About
The project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure.
It is built in hierarchy order of modules.
The modules contain number of classes with methods.
There are main/common/helpers/actions/page_object modules.
In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code.
Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications.
Big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can easy maintained! 

### Project Overview
The project is an example of infrastructure of automation testing of diffrenet kinds of applications:
* Web based application
* Mobile application
* Web API
* Electron application
* Desktop application

### Infrastructure project includes using of:
* Page Object Design Pattern
* Project Layers (Extensions/Work Flows/Test case...)
* Support of Diffrenet Clients/browsers.
* Failure Mechanism
* Common Functionality
* External Files Support
* Reporting System (including screenshots)
* Visual Testing
* DB support
* CI support
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### List of applications were udes in this project:
* Grafana webpage - Web based application
* Mortgage calculator - Mobile application
* Grafana API - Web API
* Electron application
* Windows calculator - Desktop application

### Tools & Frameworks used in the project:
* TestNG - Testing Framework 
* Listeners - interface used to grafana logs and customize the testNG reports
* MySQL Free Online DB - used for login to Grafana web page
* Jenkins - for tests excution
* Rest Assured - for API testing
* Allure Reports - as the main reporting system

### Tests Execution
Each of the applications has a few tests for demonstration purpose.
These tests can be developed in very simple way, due to a ot of work with the infrastructure. [Sanity Tests]
